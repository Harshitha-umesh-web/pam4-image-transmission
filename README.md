# PAM-4 Image Transmission (Python)

This project implements an end-to-end PAM-4 image transmission system to study how communication impairments affect real image data. The goal is to bridge concepts from digital communication and signal integrity with practical image-level validation.

---

## Project Overview

In this project, an RGB image is:
1. Converted into a binary bitstream
2. Mapped to PAM-4 symbols
3. Transmitted through a noisy and ISI-impaired channel
4. Quantized using a finite-resolution ADC
5. Equalized and demodulated at the receiver
6. Reconstructed back into an image

Performance is evaluated using **BER (Bit Error Rate)** and **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**.

---

## System Features

- PAM-4 modulation and demodulation
- Root Raised Cosine (RRC) pulse shaping
- Inter-symbol interference (ISI) channel modeling
- Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
- ADC quantization (configurable bit resolution)
- Timing phase selection
- Linear equalization
- BER and image-quality evaluation

## System Flow

1. Load input RGB image  
2. Convert image pixels into a binary bitstream  
3. Group bits and map them to PAM-4 symbols (2 bits per symbol)  
4. Apply Root Raised Cosine (RRC) pulse shaping  
5. Transmit the signal through a channel with:
   - Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN)
   - Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI)
6. Receiver processing includes:
   - Matched filtering
   - Optimal sampling phase selection
   - PAM-4 symbol detection
   - Bit reconstruction
7. Reconstruct the image from recovered bits  
8. Evaluate performance using BER and PSNR  
9. Generate plots and image comparison results

## Example Run Configuration

- Image size: **512 × 512 RGB**
- Modulation: **PAM-4**
- SNR: **15 dB**
- ADC resolution: **8 bits**
- Oversampling factor: **8 samples/symbol**
- RRC roll-off factor: **0.25**
- ISI channel taps: [0.85, 0.35, -0.18, 0.08]

### Channel & Receiver Parameters

- ISI channel taps: [0.85, 0.35, -0.18, 0.08]
- Pulse shaping: Root Raised Cosine (RRC)
  - Roll-off factor (β): 0.25
  - Filter span: 10 symbols
- Receiver equalizer: Linear FFE
- Timing recovery: Best sampling phase selected (0–7)

## Key Results

- **Bit Error Rate (BER):**  
  `4.69 × 10⁻⁴`

- **Image Quality (PSNR):**  
  `39.9 dB`

Despite channel noise and quantization, the reconstructed image maintains high visual fidelity, with errors appearing sparsely and without structural distortion.

The error map highlights pixel locations affected by bit errors, demonstrating how physical-layer impairments translate into localized image artifacts.

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how:
- Physical-layer impairments impact real data
- ADC resolution and SNR trade-offs affect system performance
- Communication metrics (BER) relate to perceptual quality (PSNR)

The workflow reflects challenges encountered in **high-speed serial links, wireline communication, and image data transmission systems**.
